# Ignite Radio Buttons Plugin

This plugin adds [react-native-radio-buttons](https://github.com/ArnaudRinquin/react-native-radio-buttons)
to your [Ignite](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite) React Native project and provides an example of its usage.

## Usage

```
$ cd /path/to/your/project
$ ignite add radio-buttons
```

This adds `react-native-radio-buttons` to your project and generates an example under `ignite/Examples/Components/RadioButtonsExample.js`. You adapt this
example to meet the needs of your application. If you included DevScreens when you ignited your app, the example will appear on the Plugin Examples screen.
