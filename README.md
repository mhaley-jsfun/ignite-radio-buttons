# Ignite Maps Plugin

This plugin adds [react-native-radio-buttons](https://github.com/ArnaudRinquin/react-native-radio-buttons)
to your [Ignite](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite) React Native project and provides an example of its usage.

## Usage

```
$ cd /path/to/your/project
$ ignite add radio-buttons
```

This adds `react-native-radio-buttons` to your project and generates an example under `ignite/Examples/Components/RadioButtonsExample.js`. You adapt this
example to meet the needs of your application. If you included DevScreens when you ignited your app, the example will appear on the Plugin Examples screen.

That's it!
